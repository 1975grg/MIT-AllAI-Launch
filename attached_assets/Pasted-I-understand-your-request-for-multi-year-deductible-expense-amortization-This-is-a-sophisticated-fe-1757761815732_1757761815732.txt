I understand your request for multi-year deductible expense amortization! This is a sophisticated feature that would allow users to spread large deductible expenses over multiple years for more accurate tax planning.

Let me first understand the current expense system and then get architectural guidance on the best approach:


Searched for "Find how deductible expenses are currently handled, stored, and displayed. Look for expense categories with checkmarks and deductible status tracking"

Designed multi-year expense amortization system

Planned amortization expense integration (12 seconds)
Perfect! I can see exactly what you're looking for. From the screenshot, I can see the expense categories with checkmarks (✓) indicating deductible status, and you want to add multi-year amortization for these deductible expenses.

The architect has provided an excellent comprehensive plan that addresses your concerns about display errors and storage complexity. Here's the approach:

🏗️ Multi-Year Expense Amortization Architecture
1. Enhanced UI Clarity
Problem: Checkmarks aren't clear enough for deductible indication
Solution:

Better visual badges: "Tax Deductible ✓" vs "Not Deductible ⚠"
Clearer category tooltips explaining tax status
Color-coded indicators (green/orange)
2. Amortization Feature Design
For deductible expenses only, add a "Deduction Method" selector:

┌─ Deduction Method ─────────────────┐
│ ○ Full deduction this year (default)│ 
│ ○ Amortize over: [5 years ▼]       │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
Dropdown options: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years

3. Data Storage Strategy
Your concern: "Storage and matching errors"
Solution: Extend existing transactions table (no new tables needed):

// Add to existing transaction:
isAmortized: boolean (default: false)
amortizationYears: integer (2-40)  
amortizationStartDate: timestamp
amortizationMethod: 'straight_line'
4. Display & Calculations
Your concern: "Display logic errors"
Solution: Pure calculation functions (no stored derived data):

getExpenseDeductionForYear(expense, year) {
  if (!expense.isAmortized) return expense.amount;
  return expense.amount / expense.amortizationYears; // Simple straight-line
}
Tax Page: Shows only current year portions
Expense List: Shows badges like "Amortized • 5 yrs" + current year amount

5. Multi-Year Tracking
Example: $10,000 roof repair amortized over 5 years

2025: $2,000 deductible (shown in tax calculations)
2026-2029: $2,000 each year automatically calculated
Amortization Section: Shows remaining $8,000 over 4 years
🎯 Benefits of This Approach:
✅ No display errors: All calculations derived, no stored duplicates
✅ Simple storage: Extends existing table, no complex relationships
✅ Cross-year accuracy: UTC date math prevents timezone bugs
✅ Tax compliance: Only current-year portions in tax totals
✅ User-friendly: Clear visual indicators and intuitive workflow

📋 Implementation Plan:
Schema: Add amortization fields to transactions
UI: Enhanced category indicators + amortization selector
Calculations: Pure helper functions for year-based deductions
Display: Badges, current-year amounts, amortization tracking section
Question: Does this approach address your concerns about storage complexity and display errors? Would you like me to proceed with this implementation, or do you have any modifications to suggest?

The key insight is keeping calculations derived rather than stored, which eliminates your worry about matching and display consistency issues across years.
